## Page 10: FAQs - Fund Security & Real-time Reconciliation

### Focus 1: Fund Security & Real-time Reconciliation

#### Q1: How is user fund security ensured?
**Answer**:
- **Fund Custody**: REAL account funds 100% stored at BTSE, we don't directly handle user funds
- **Pre-freeze Mechanism**: Freeze funds before order placement, ensuring sufficient funds during trading
- **Real-time Reconciliation Design**: Every transaction has complete btse_transfer_log records, supporting real-time reconciliation
- **Audit Trail**: All fund movements have account_transaction records, verifiable anytime

#### Q2: How to ensure fund data consistency between platform and BTSE?
**Answer**:
- **Three-layer Reconciliation**: Order-level, round-level, daily automatic reconciliation
- **Compensation System**: Automatic retry for abnormal transfers, automatic handling of timeout orders
- **Manual Verification**: Complete reconciliation reports and discrepancy handling process provided

---

## Page 11: FAQs - BTSE Integration Stability Assurance

### Focus 2: BTSE Integration Stability Assurance

#### Q3: How does the system respond when BTSE API is unavailable?
**Answer**:
- **Multi-layer Retry Mechanism**: Auto-retry 3 times with exponential backoff strategy
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Auto circuit break on API anomaly, protecting system stability
- **Compensation System**: Scheduled tasks handle failed transfers and hedge operations
- **Degradation Strategy**: When BTSE unavailable, DEMO trading unaffected, REAL trading pauses with user notification

#### Q4: How to monitor BTSE integration health status?
**Answer**:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Check BTSE API health every 30 seconds
- **Alert Mechanism**: Immediate alert notifications on API anomaly
- **Status Panel**: Admin dashboard displays BTSE connection status and response time
- **Auto Recovery**: Automatic service restart when API recovers

---

## Page 12: FAQs - System Scalability

### Focus 3: System Scalability

#### Q5: How much user growth can the platform support?
**Answer**:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service scales independently, supports horizontal scaling
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis cluster, 95% cache hit rate, reduces database pressure
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx auto-scaling (K8S can be considered in future)

#### Q6: How scalable are new trading pairs and features?
**Answer**:
- **Configuration-based Design**: New trading pairs only need configuration, no code changes
- **Plugin Architecture**: New features through modular development, no impact on existing system
- **API Standardization**: Unified interface specifications, easy integration of new external services
- **Database Design**: Reserved extension fields, supports rapid business iteration

## Page 13: FAQs - System Usability

### Focus 4: System Usability

#### Q7: Is the learning and usage cost high for users?
**Answer**:
- **Zero Registration Process**: BTSE users use directly, no additional registration needed
- **DEMO Experience**: New users experience DEMO trading first, lowering learning threshold
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple trading interface, mastered in 5 minutes
- **Real-time Guidance**: Clear step prompts in trading process

#### Q8: Is platform management and operations complex?
**Answer**:
- **Automated Operations**: Scheduled tasks automatically handle settlement, reconciliation, compensation

- **Alternative Plans**: Reserved multi-exchange integration interfaces, quick switching capability
- **Risk Monitoring**: Real-time API stability monitoring, advance warnings

#### Q10: How to handle extended BTSE service interruption?
**Answer**:
- **Business Degradation**: DEMO trading continues, REAL trading pauses
- **User Notification**: Timely notify users of service status and expected recovery time
- **Data Protection**: All trading data preserved intact, auto-processing after recovery

## Page 15: Business Expansion - SaaS Service Planning

### Focus 6: Business Expansion

#### Q11: Are there plans to develop BinaryOption into a SaaS service for other platforms to integrate?
**Answer**:
- **Business Prospect**: Indeed planned, this is a promising business model
- **Technical Reserve**: Our microservices architecture naturally supports multi-tenancy
- **Standardized Design**: Three core standardized integration solutions already considered

### SaaS Integration Standardization Solutions

#### 1. User Integration Standards
- **Unified User Identification**: Support OAuth, JWT, API Key and other authentication methods
- **User Mapping Mechanism**: Establish mapping between third-party platform user IDs and BinaryOption user IDs
- **Permission Control**: Role-based permission management, supports customized permissions for different platforms
- **User Data Isolation**: Complete multi-tenant data isolation, ensuring data security

#### 2. Account Integration Standards
- **Account Type Extension**: Support DEMO and REAL account types
- **Fund Flow Standardization**: Unified fund in/out interfaces, adapt to different platforms' fund management methods
- **Risk Control Parameter Configuration**: Each integrated platform can customize risk control rules and trading limits

#### 3. Page Integration Standards
- **White Label Solution**: Fully customizable UI themes and brand identity
- **iframe Standardization**: Provide standard iframe embedding SDK, support responsive design
- **API Interface**: Provide complete REST API, support custom frontend development
- **Component-based Design**: Trading components, chart components, account components can be embedded independently

## Page 16: Expected Revenue Models

### Expected Revenue Models

#### 1. Tiered Commission Sharing Model
- **Monthly Volume < $1M**: Share 20% of trading fees
- **Monthly Volume > $20M**: Share 10% of trading fees
- **Advantage**: Win-win with client business growth, incentivize clients to increase volume

#### 2. Fixed Annual Fee Model
- **Basic**: $50K/year, supports 50K DAU, basic features
- **Professional**: $150K/year, supports 200K DAU, advanced analytics + risk control
- **Overage Fees**: Excess users charged at $1/user/year

#### 3. Hybrid Model (Recommended)
- **Annual Fee**: Covers platform base costs and technical support
- **Revenue Share**: Performance-based revenue sharing
- **Example**: Professional annual fee $100K + 10-15% fee sharing

### Technical Implementation Advantages
- **Existing Architecture**: Microservices architecture naturally supports multi-tenancy
- **Data Isolation**: Complete data isolation through tenant ID
- **Configuration-based**: Trading parameters, UI themes, risk control rules all configurable
- **Rapid Deployment**: New client integration only needs 2-3 days for configuration and testing
