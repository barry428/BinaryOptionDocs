Internal Standard for Application Logging

Version: 0.3
Date:25th June, 2025
Author: Jimmy.lin
Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a standardized approach to logging across
all applications within our organization. This standard aims to ensure consistency,
improve log readability, and facilitate easier debugging and monitoring across different
applications.
Scope
This standard applies to all software applications developed, deployed, or maintained by
BTSE, regardless of the programming language or platform used.


1. Log File Location and Naming Convention
Currently, log file locations and naming conventions vary across different services and
applications. However, a standard naming convention is maintained to ensure
consistency in identifying and managing log files.
Note on Future Unification of Log Paths:
Target Update: In the future, all applications and services will standardize the log file
path to /var/log/app_logs/ to consolidate log management and facilitate easier access
and monitoring. The timeline and details for this transition will be communicated in due
course.
General Services (Tomcat)
● Services: spot, futures, admin
● Log Path: /usr/local/tomcat/logs/
● Naming Convention:
Application type: {service_name}-{type}.log
GC type: gc.log
● Specific Requirement: For Tomcat-based applications, logging must be
configured to enable the creation of different logs for varying purposes (e.g.,
access logs, error logs, application-specific logs) to ensure comprehensive
monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.
Micro Services
Microservices will follow a more service-specific log path, reflecting their operational
domain and ensuring logs are easily locatable within their respective service directories.
● Services: walletservice, tradeview, payment, oauth, fix-server, scheduler-service,
3rd-party-login, sumup, message, ipservice, user-report, upload-service,
aquanow-liquidity, vendor-service
● Log Path: Varies by service, typically follows /usr/local/btse/logs for services
without a specific log directory.
● Naming Convention:
Application type: {service_name}-{type}.log
GC type: gc.log


For services with a unique log path (e.g., 3rd-party-login), the specific path provided
must be used.
Node JS
Node JS services will adhere to their respective directories with a uniform naming
convention for log files.
● Example Services: node-universe, position_taking, trading-competition
● Log Path: Varies by service, e.g., /usr/local/{service}/logs/
● Naming Convention:
Application type: {service_name}-{type}.log
GC type: gc.log


Pricer
Pricer services focus on specific financial and pricing functionalities and will follow a
dedicated log path convention.
● Example Services: funding-rate-monitor, fiat-exchange-rate
● Log Path: Generally follows /usr/local/{service}/logs/
● Naming Convention:
Application type: {service_name}-{type}.log
GC type: gc.log

2. Log Format
To ensure consistency in log information across all applications, the following log
format must be adopted:
Timestamp LogLevel PID [thread] [class] [call-id] [trace-id] [user-name]
[IP-address] [error-code] : msg%n
● Timestamp: ISO 8601 format, e.g., 2024-03-11T14:55:30,000+00:00
● LogLevel: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL.
● PID: Process ID of the process that logged the event.
● thread: Execution thread identifier.
● class: Source class or component.
● call-id: An identifier for the individual call instance.
● trace-id: An identifier used to track the trace through the system.
● user-name: The username of the user involved in the event, if applicable.
● IP-address: The IP address from which the request originated, if applicable.
● Error-code: An identifier for the error status
● msg%n: The message content, where %n indicates that the message is optional
and can accommodate newline characters if present
Compliance
All development teams are required to update their applications to comply with this
logging standard upon release. Compliance will be reviewed through code audits and
log file inspections.
Amendment and Revision
This standard is subject to review and amendment. Suggestions for improvement are
welcome and should be submitted to the [Release member].
